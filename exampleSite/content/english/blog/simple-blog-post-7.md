Hi, I'm Najnin Malek!

I'm currently a student at George Brown College and I'm planning on beginning to pursue an Architecture undergraduate degree from Toronto Metropolitan University this upcoming fall.

In 2020-2022 I studied at George Brown College and got my Architectural Technician diploma. I'm currently in pursuit of an Art diploma from George Brown College.

On this website, you'll find some of my projects and my resume.
